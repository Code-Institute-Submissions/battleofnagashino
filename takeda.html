<article><h3>Takeda Clan<img src="images/takedacrest.svg" width="120" height="120"></h3>
<p>The Takeda army were a battle hardened, well trained samurai battalion. Takeda Katsuyori, in an effort to gain control of the nation, was beginning an advance of the capital, Kyoto. To march on Kyoto necessitated crossing the lands owned by both Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga. The Takeda had soundly defeated the Tokugawa at the Battle of Mikatagahara some years before, and were confident of another victory. This time however, the concern was the Tokugawa’s strong ally, Oda Nobunaga.<a href="https://en.japantravel.com/aichi/battle-of-nagashino-and-shitaragahara/152">[1]</a></p></article>
