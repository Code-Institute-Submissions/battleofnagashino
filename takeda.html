<article><h3>Takeda Clan<img src="assets/images/takedacrest.svg" class="smallimg" width="120" height="120" alt="The Takeda family crest"></h3>
<p>The Takeda army were a battle hardened, well trained samurai battalion. Takeda Katsuyori, in an effort to gain control of the nation, was beginning an advance of the capital, Kyoto. To march on Kyoto necessitated crossing the lands owned by both Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga. The Takeda had soundly defeated the Tokugawa at the Battle of Mikatagahara some years before, and were confident of another victory. This time however, the concern was the Tokugawa’s strong ally, Oda Nobunaga.<a href="https://en.japantravel.com/aichi/battle-of-nagashino-and-shitaragahara/152" class="cite" target="_blank">[1]</a></p></article>

<article><h3>Takeda Katsuyori<img src="assets/images/katsuyori.jpg" class="smallimg" height="141" width="105" alt="An illustration of Takeda Katsuyori"></h3>
<p>Katsuyori gained a reputation as a fearless fighter in Shingen's battles against the Hôjô and Tokugawa families. In the 4th month of 1573, while campaigning against Tokugawa Ieyasu, Shingen fell ill and then died at Kobata in Shinano Province. Katsuyori led the Takeda army back to Kai in the aftermath and assumed leadership of the clan.<a href="https://samurai-archives.com/wiki/Takeda_Katsuyori" class="cite" target="_blank">[1]</a> In 1574, he captured Takatenjin castle, which even his father had not managed to do. This gained him the support of the Takeda clan.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeda_Katsuyori" class="cite" target="_blank">[2]</a> After Katsuyori lost Takatenjin fortress and Takatō castle, many clans like Kiso and Anayama withdrew their support for Takeda. The Oda-Tokugawa alliance advanced into Kai Province, and laid siege to Shinpu Castle, Katsuyori was unable to hold the castle with his remaining 300-400 men, so he set fire to Shinpu Castle and fled into the Tenmoku mountain. Later, his forces were destroyed by the combined armies of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Tenmokuzan, after which Katsuyori, his wife, and his son committed ritual suicide, known as seppuku. It was the end of Takeda clan.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeda_Katsuyori" class="cite" target="_blank">[2]</a></p></article>

<p>Takeda Shingen, original name Takeda Harunobu, daimyo and one of the most-famous military leaders of Japan, who struggled for mastery of the strategic Kantō Plain in east-central Honshu during the chaotic Sengoku period of civil unrest in the 16th century. Takeda is especially well known for his series of battles (1553–64) with the noted warrior Uesugi Kenshin, which not only are famous in the annals of Japanese history but are also much celebrated in Japanese drama and folklore.<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Takeda-Shingen" class="cite" target="_blank">[1]</a></p></article>
