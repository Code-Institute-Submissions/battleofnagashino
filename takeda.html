<article><h3>Takeda Clan<img src="images/takedacrest.svg" class="smallimg" width="120" height="120"></h3>
<p>The Takeda army were a battle hardened, well trained samurai battalion. Takeda Katsuyori, in an effort to gain control of the nation, was beginning an advance of the capital, Kyoto. To march on Kyoto necessitated crossing the lands owned by both Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga. The Takeda had soundly defeated the Tokugawa at the Battle of Mikatagahara some years before, and were confident of another victory. This time however, the concern was the Tokugawa’s strong ally, Oda Nobunaga.<a href="https://en.japantravel.com/aichi/battle-of-nagashino-and-shitaragahara/152">[1]</a></p></article>

<article><h3>Takeda Katsuyori<img src="images/katsuyori.jpg" class="smallimg" height="100" width="74"></h3>
<p>Katsuyori gained a reputation as a fearless fighter in Shingen's battles against the Hôjô and Tokugawa families. In the 4th month of 1573, while campaigning against Tokugawa Ieyasu, Shingen fell ill and then died at Kobata in Shinano Province. Katsuyori led the Takeda army back to Kai in the aftermath and assumed leadership of the clan.<a href="https://samurai-archives.com/wiki/Takeda_Katsuyori">[1]</a> In 1574, he captured Takatenjin castle, which even his father had not managed to do. This gained him the support of the Takeda clan.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeda_Katsuyori">[2]</a></p></article>
