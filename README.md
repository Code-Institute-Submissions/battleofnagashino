# The Battle of Nagashino

The Battle of Nagashino is a site where you can learn about the events of the battle in 1573 and the key people involved 

## Features 


 - Navigation Menu

 - Featured on all four pages, the Navigation Menu includes links to each of the clans and key people and technologies in the battle, and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
 - It will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 
 - the color scheme I used was to make it easy to read and also to make it feel more alive

The background image of the site

 - The background image is an illustration of the battle of nagashino I used it because its bigger than most device resolutions and brings the site to life a bit more.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
