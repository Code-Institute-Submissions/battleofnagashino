<article><h3>Tanegashima</h3>
<p>They were introduced to Japan in 1543 by Portuguese traders who landed by accident on Tanegashima, an island south of Kyūshū in the region controlled by the Shimazu clan. By 1550, arquebuses known as tanegashima, teppō or hinawaju were being produced in large numbers in Japan. The tanegashima seem to have utilized snap matchlocks based on firearms from Goa, India, which was captured by the Portuguese in 1510. Within ten years of its introduction upwards of three hundred thousand tanegashima were reported to have been manufactured.<a href="https://brewminate.com/arquebus-long-guns-in-the-late-medieval-and-early-modern-eras/">[1]</a></p></article>
